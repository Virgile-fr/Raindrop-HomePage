# ⭐ Raindrop Homepage

Raindrop Homepage is a minimal start page to display your **Raindrop.io bookmarks marked as favorites**.  
It is **not** intended to replicate the full Raindrop.io interface, only to give you a clean, fast way to open your favorite links from any browser or device.

---

## ✨ Why this project?

I built this page because for my own use it is the simplest way to:

- ✅ Access all my Raindrop favorites quickly
- 🌐 Use the same favorites across all browsers and devices
- 🔁 Avoid dealing with browser sync, especially on safari that only syncs favs with other browsers on Windows using the iCloud plugin

Set Raindrop Homepage as your **start page** or **new tab page** and you get a lightweight, always up to date favorites dashboard.

## 🚀 Live usage

Public instance:

```text
https://virgile-fr.github.io/Raindrop-HomePage/
````

You have **two ways** to provide your Raindrop test token:

### 1. 🔑 Quick method: token in the URL

Append your Raindrop test token at the end of the URL, for example:

```text
https://virgile-fr.github.io/Raindrop-HomePage/XXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXX-XXX
```

Raindrop Homepage will read that token, use it to call the Raindrop API and store it in your browser `localStorage`.
Do not share this URL publicly since it contains your token.

### 2. 💬 Token prompt / local storage

If no valid token is found, the page will display a prompt asking you to paste your **Raindrop test token**.
Once entered, it is stored in `localStorage` so you do not have to paste it again on the same browser.

> ⚠️ If you clear your browser cache or storage, the token will be removed and the prompt will appear again.

## 🧩 How to get your Raindrop test token

1. Make sure you are logged in to your **Raindrop.io** account.
2. Open:
   `https://app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations`
3. Click **“+ Create a new app”**.
4. Choose any name, for example: `MyUsername Homepage`.
5. Accept the **Raindrop API Terms & Guidelines**.
6. Click on the app you just created.
7. Click **“Create test token”** and copy the token.
8. Use it:

   * Either by pasting it in the Raindrop Homepage prompt
   * Or by appending it after the URL like this:
     `https://virgile-fr.github.io/Raindrop-HomePage/YOUR_TEST_TOKEN`

## 🏗️ Self-hosting / using the code locally

If you want to host your own instance (for example on GitHub Pages or your own server):

1. Clone the repository.
2. Optionally, set your token directly in `token.js` if you do not want to use the prompt or URL method.
3. Deploy the static files to your hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

## 👀 Views and layout

Raindrop Homepage offers two display modes that you can toggle using the switch in the top right corner.

### 🌐 Favicon view

* Icons are fetched using the **Google Icons API**, which is one of the best free options available.
* Some favicons might still appear in low resolution depending on the site.
* Each card uses a `backdrop-filter` effect for a frosted glass style background.
* Technically, it would be possible to fetch `apple-touch-icon` tags from each site, but this is not implemented yet.

### 🖼️ Cover view

* Uses the **covers automatically generated by Raindrop.io**.
* Covers can be customized directly in the Raindrop app.
* This view is useful if you prefer a more visual, card based layout instead of tiny icons.

---

## 📱 Safari and mobile usage

* On **iOS Safari**, you cannot set a custom homepage.
* Recommended workflow:

  1. Open Raindrop Homepage in Safari.
  2. Use **“Add to Home Screen”**.
  3. Launch it from the icon on your home screen instead of opening Safari directly.

This gives you a near “app like” experience for your Raindrop favorites.

---

## 🔒 Token storage and security

* The app uses your **Raindrop test token** only from **your browser** to call the Raindrop API.
* The token is stored in **`localStorage`** on your device, not on a remote server.
* Clearing site data or cache will remove the token and trigger the token prompt again.
* If you use the URL method, remember that the token is visible in the address bar and in your browser history, so avoid sharing that URL.

---

## 🧾 Notes

* This project is an **unofficial** tool built on top of the **Raindrop.io API**.
* It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Raindrop.io.
* It is a small, focused utility to make Raindrop favorites feel like a simple homepage.
